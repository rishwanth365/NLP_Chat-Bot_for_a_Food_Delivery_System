# End-to-End NLP Chat-Bot for a Food Delivery System

I built a chatbot in Dialogflow for a food delivery system. It will be an end-to-end project covering Dialogflow basics, building a backend in python and Fastapi, interactions with MySQL database, and much more. I covered Dialogflow fundamentals such as intents, entities, contexts, etc.

## Problem Statement:

Unfortunately his aplication has not been accepted. So, he decided to build a custom website for his customers which includes his food menu and delivery system. As of now everything is fine it raise his customer base but problem is there is no customer support in his website hiring customer support is not budjet friendly for him so he decided to create a chat-bot that it can understand customer intrest and displays menu accordingly it can remember the past orders of the customer asks customer to whether to repeat same order or not, it can take orders and displays expected delivery time.
